    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <div class="project">
      <strong>Maintenance Logs</strong><br>
      <em>C#, .Net, SQL Server</em>
      <p>New application that was quickly developed to maintain
          overlook of team work on site, later it grow to also input
          nonconformity found on new equipment and machines to keep
          track with suppliers if these nonconformity was resolved.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <strong>Part Counter</strong><br>
      <em>C# .net, Kepserver, SQL Server</em>
      <p>After maintenance moved some screens on line that displayed
        this information, logistic workers didn’t have access to
        information when next change of production will be made. I was
        asked if it is possible to read this information from PLC and
        display it on standard PC screen. This was my first simple
        application that worked with OPC server.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="project">
      <strong>Overwatch</strong><br>
      <em>Visual studio, S7.net wrapper, c# .net, GIMP (for design of icons etc.)</em>
      <p>Need for new application rose when plant workers didn’t have
          actual information about what material they are going to process
          next based on the conveyor system that was coming from the
          previous plant (waste processing). Without the possibility to use
          OPC server a s7.net wrapper was used to obtain information
          directly from registers of Siemens PLC and it was used to display
          information on screen for the workers to know what kind of
          material is being processed. It helped the company to be more efficient.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="project">
      <strong>Q-slides</strong><br>
      <em>C# .Net, SQL, OPC Server</em>
      <p>Small application that read out more data from OPC server.
        When production batch changed to new reference, application
        automatically looked for images corresponding to that reference
        and displayed the first image. Then during each part produced
        by the line, this image changed to the next. It cycled through
        images of zonal control, quality alerts etc.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="project">
      <strong>LineSpy</strong><br>
      <em>C#.net, Visual studio, OPC Server</em>
      <p>Small visual application that displayed information about current
          and past status of all production lines in plant. It graphed the
          speed of production for last hour of each line, showed the
          current producing batch etc.</p>
    </div>
        <div class="project">
      <strong>Process Control Tool</strong><br>
      <em>Visual studio, C#.net, SQL, Microsoft SQL Management studio,
          KepServer (Dataloger), PdfSharp (to fill PDF form with
          parameters for printing), hashing of password to secure
          password in hash form in database</em>
      <p>Application that used OPC server (KepServer Datalogger) to
        store all parameters of whole lines during “save of parameters”
        operation to SQL database. The whole application uses login with
        password verification to permit access only to authorized
        personal to accept or reject new changes to the parameters
        done on the press line. User with operator status is capable only
        to add comment to the changes made by him with parameters
        and view (or print in PDF) master copy of approved parameters.
        Engineering can also access history of changes to parameters
        (for audit purpose) and is also capable to track process
        parameters during each production (like press force for
        example).</p>
    </div>
            <div class="project">
      <strong>Process control tool – Notify center</strong><br>
      <em>C#.net, Visual studio, SQL</em>
      <p>Small windows service to send email report on daily basis with
        information about database status to responsible team
        (parameters waiting for approval etc.)</p>
    </div>
        <div class="project">
      <strong>SmartHome</strong><br>
      <em>ModeBus, NodeRed, InfluxDb, Grafana, Windows server, Arduino
      programming, ESP programming, PCB desing, MQTT</em>
      <p>Integrating and automatizating processes in household to
      smart home ecosystem. From light control, blinds control based
      on sun orientation and position, to heating control based on
      presence of people in house to energy management, water
      usage etc.</p>
